Research Computing @ Rice
=========================

The Center for Research Computing (CRC) manages shared computational clusters
for a wide range of research projects affiliated with Rice University and the
Texas Medical Center.

The CRC administers and maintains infrastructure in four core service areas:
Shared Computing Clusters, the Research Data Facility, the High-Speed Data
Transfer infrastructure, High-Performance Visualization, and Virtual Machines.
While these services often fit together, each provides unique capabilities
designed to accommodate specific research tasks.
